This is the course page
for the seminar course
_Computational Morphology_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

This is a seminar course covering a wide range of different
approaches for computational processing of natural language
morphology. We will cover both rule-based (finite-state) systems
and data-driven models of both supervised and unsupervised
morphological processing.

The course will run in two parallel streams.
On one hand, there will be a series of lectures and tutorials, 
where fundamental topics and tools will be introduced.
On the other hand, we will follow a seminar format, where we will read
a selection of influential and/or recent papers from the literature,
and discuss them in the class.
The participants will also be required to complete small projects.

The questions of interest for this course include:

- Can we (precisely and computationally) describe morphology of a
  language?
- Can we, or to what extent, segment words in natural languages to
  segments that correspond to morphemes?
- What is a word?
- How can we discover words in speech, or texts written without clear
  hints to word boundaries?
- Can we build models of morphological processing purely
    in a data-driven manner?
- Do we still need rule-based models/descriptions of natural
  languages?
- Can we help document low-resource, endangered language with the help
  of computational methods?
- Can we study morphological typology, the morphological differences
  between the  world's languages, with computational and quantitative
  methods?
- What makes a language morphologically complex or rich?
- Can we quantify morphological complexity?
- Is linguistic morphology relevant to natural language processing?

Grading will be based on class participation and assignments (6ECTS).
Further course credits can be obtained by 
a term project described in a term paper (9ECTS)
within the scope of the course.

## Requirements

There are no formal requirements.
However, this is an advanced course where the participants are expected 
to read and understand a broad range of topics including 
finite-state automata and various machine learning methods.
